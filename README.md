# gif-j

gif-j is a simple, python-based gif viewer that utilizes tkinter to display the gif. It has no buttons, no extra fluff, just a window to display your gif of choice. Think of it as a way to spice up your desktop while studying, working, or anything really. 

To display your gif of choice, you will need to:

1. Split gif into seperate frames and place into the directory "gifs"

2. Resize accordingly by editing the size tuple in the main.py file

3. Enjoy!
