# gif-j

gif-j is a simple, python-based gif viewer that utilizes tkinter to display the gif. It has no buttons, no extra fluff, just a window to display your gif of choice. Think of it as a way to spice up your desktop while studying, working, or anything really.. To run the program, simply cd into the gif-j directory and run python main.py in the command line.







To display your own gif, you will need to:


  1. Split your gif of choice into separate frames. (Instructions below)

  2. Change the gif_file variable, gif_file = 'sample_gif', to the directory name that you are holding the split images in (within the gif-j directory)

  3. Resize accordingly by editing the size tuple in the main.py file


Hope you enjoy!
