# gif-j

gif-j is a simple, python-based gif viewer that utilizes tkinter to display the gif. It has no buttons, no extra fluff, just a window to display your gif of choice. Think of it as a way to spice up your desktop while studying, working, or anything really.. 

To display your gif, you will need to:

1. Split gif into separate frames and place into the directory "gifs". (instruction below to do through a web tool)

2. Resize accordingly by editing the size tuple in the main.py file

Hope you enjoy!
